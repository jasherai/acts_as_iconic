ActsAsIconic
============

This plugin will add an icon to files uploaded via attachment_fu.  This checks the mime_type of the file and add the appropriate icon.  If no icon is discovered, the "unknown icon" image is returned.

Example
=======

Attachment < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_iconic
end

Now you have the "icon_path" method for any Attachment object.  Based on the mime_type listed in the database a path to the icon image will be added.

<%= image_tag @this_attachment.icon_path %>

script/generate acts_as_iconic

2. Run migration to create icon and mime_type tables
